            Conference (APSEC 2021)</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="text-faded mb-2">The Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC) has long been established
            as a premier regional conference that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry
            and government to share the state of the art and the practice of software engineering, and to explore
            emerging challenges and solutions in software engineering innovation. APSEC 2021 will continue in the
            tradition of previous editions of this regional conference. As past APSEC series, the main research track
            features the most recent and significant innovations in the field of software engineering and all its
            sub-disciplines. APSEC 2021 also invites submissions of high-quality research papers that describe original
            and
            unpublished results on all topics of both theoretical and empirical software engineering research.</p>

          <p class="text-faded mb-2">
            APSEC 2021 will offer an extensive program of interest to academia, government, and industry. It will
            include
            several distinguished keynote speakers and conference days of paper presentations and demos. A
            series of exciting tutorials to develop skills in various aspects of software engineering practices is of
            particular interest to the industry. Co-located workshops offer forums for participants to present novel
            techniques and methods in specific sub-disciplines
            of software engineering.</p>

          <!-- <p class="text-white mb-2">
  APSEC 2021 aims to explore the impact of software engineering research towards the community with the theme “Engineering Impactful Software for the Society towards IR4.0”. Indeed, there is a need to create or innovate not only new techniques, approaches or methodologies in software engineering research and practice but also to measure their impact to the society who should gain the benefits from the innovations. Challenges in software engineering should also include how to realise the needs in creating software applications that also meet the fourth industrial revolution or IR4.0 where the symbiosis of human and technology is expected.

          <p class="text-white mb-2"><strong>Important notice:</strong> APSEC 2021 will be held in an <strong>online/onsite hybrid model</strong> to ensure effective interaction between online participants (participants that are not at the venue) and onsite participants (participants that can attend the venue). For online sessions, session chairs will play presentation video clips pre-recorded by the authors and initiate online discussion. In the conference venue, each onsite session is broadcasted in an online chatroom, so that the online/onsite participants can join both online/onsite sessions.</p> -->
		  
		  <p class="text-white mb-2"><strong>Important notice:</strong> 
		  Due to the concerns over the participants' health and safety and the travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the APSEC 2021 organizing committee decided to hold the conference totally online. In online sessions, session chairs will play presentation video clips pre-recorded by the authors and initiate online discussion. We would be very grateful if you could support APSEC. Looking forward to seeing you online in APSEC 2021! </p>

              Poster papers should present work in progress and be based on either research, practice or experience.
              Poster papers are not required to report complete results as full conference papers, so they are a good

              The poster session at APSEC 2021 aims to bring like-minded people together in an interactive setting.
              Effectively designed posters convey the essence of an idea, an experience or a piece of research in an
              appealing manner. The work presented in a poster does not have to be fully developed and can be a good way
              to get early feedback on new ideas. A good poster will encourage conference participants to interact with
              others who are also attracted to the poster topic, and could be a catalyst for developing and extending
              topic networks.

      <h2 class="mb-4">Call for Workshops</h2>
      <p>The APSEC 2021 workshops will provide a forum to discuss current topics in software engineering research and
        practice, offering opportunities for researchers to exchange and discuss innovative scientific and engineering
        ideas at a stage before they have matured to warrant conference or journal publication, as well as new
        developments in the field. APSEC workshops also serve as incubators for scientific ideas or new scientific
        communities that form and share a particular research agenda. APSEC Workshops should not be seen as an
        alternative forum for presenting full research papers.</p>

      <p>We encourage those interested in organizing a workshop to submit proposals focusing on any aspect of APSEC
        2021. Each workshop can be full or half day and should highlight a specific topic of interest related to ongoing
        research or industrial projects on software engineering.</p>

      <hr class="my-4">

      <p><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong>
        Workshop proposals will be judged on their originality, relevance to the topics of APSEC 2021, the expected
        level of interest in the topic, and the organizers’ ability to lead a successful workshop. The accepted
        workshops will be scheduled by the APSEC Organizing Committee to fit the overall program of the conference.</p>

      <hr class="my-4">

      <p><strong>Submission Instructions:</strong>
        Please send your proposal via email to ypcheng@csie.ncu.edu.tw (Yung-Pin Cheng) and jielee@mail.ncku.edu.tw

      <p>Taiwan enjoys warm weather all year round, making it an ideal travel destination. Taiwan’s temperature is
        extremely suitable for traveling, as the annual average temperature is a comfortable 22 degrees Celsius with the
        lowest temperatures on the lowlands generally ranging from 12 to 17 degrees Celsius (54-63 Fahrenheit). Taiwan
        has a diversified culture, which is a hybrid blend of various and regional sources attributed to the historic
        and ancestral origin of its current residents, incorporating elements of traditional Chinese culture, Japanese
        culture, Asian religions, and increasingly Western values. Today, Taiwan boasts an excellent infrastructure,
        convenient transportation system, and high-quality communication services. Taiwan food is a mash-up of the
        cuisine of the Min Nan, Teochew, and Hokkien Chinese communities, along with Japanese cooking. In the vote of
        CNN in 2015, Taiwan food, such as stinky tofu or mind-blowing beef noodle soup, wins the title of “world's best
        food”. According to the survey in 2015 by News Corp Australia (one of Australia's largest media conglomerates),
        Taiwan is one of the top 10 best bargain holiday destinations in the world. </p>

              <p class="mb-2 text-white"><strong>Title:</strong> Trustworthy Software and Automated Program Repair</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-white"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Symbolic analysis of programs were first studied for the purpose of program verification. 
                In recent decades, symbolic execution technology has witnessed renewed interest due to the maturity of Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers. We have leveraged the back-end solvers to systematically navigate large search spaces leading to application of symbolic analysis in test generation. In this talk, we will first study the power of state-of-the-art symbolic execution based approaches for detecting software vulnerabilities, such as tools for finding zero-day vulnerabilities and crash reproduction. We compare the symbolic analysis approaches to grey-box fuzz testing approaches which are routinely employed in industrial settings for finding vulnerabilities in programs, to understand the ongoing work in industry practice.</p> 
                
                <p class="mb-2 text-white">In the later part of the talk, we will conceptualize the use of symbolic approaches and tools for purposes beyond guiding search. We will sketch the usage of symbolic execution in inferring specification of intended program behavior, even when no formal models are available.This is done by analyzing a buggy program against selected tests. Such specification inference capability can be combined with program synthesis 
                technology to automatically repair programs. Automated program repair via symbolic execution goes beyond search-based approaches which lift patches from elsewhere in the program. Such an approach can construct ìimaginativeî patches and serves as a test-bed for the grand-challenge of automated programming, It contributes to the vision of self-healing software of the future, where un-trustworthiness of learning components can be compensated via self-healing. </p>

            <p class="mb-2 text-white"><strong>Title:</strong> Formal Verification based on Interpolations</p>
            <p class="mb-2 text-white"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Formal verification techniques, such as model checking and theorem proving, have their challenging problems. For example, in symbolic model checking, one challenging problem is how to efficiently calculate a fix-point to over-approximate the system behavior for verifying a property. In program verification based on Hoare logic, one of the challenging problems is, given a loop, how to automatically generate an inductive loop invariant, which is not only strong enough to imply the post-condition but also weak enough to be implied by the pre-condition of the loop. In this talk, I will introduce several modern formal verification techniques based on interpolations and illustrate how interpolation helps to solve the above challenging problems. I will also discuss some future works in this research direction.</p>

                  <p class="mb-2 text-white"><strong>Title:</strong> Formal Verification for Side-channel Resistance of Cryptographic Programs</p>
                  <p class="mb-2 text-white"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cryptographic algorithms are widely used to protect data privacy in many aspects of our daily lives from smart card to cyber-physical systems. Unfortunately, programs implementing cryptographic algorithms may be vulnerable to practical power side-channel attacks, which infer private data via statistical analysis of the correlation between power consumptions of an electronic device and private data. To thwart these attacks, several masking schemes have been proposed, giving rise to effective countermeasures for reducing the statistical correlation between private data and power consumptions. However, programs that rely on secure masking schemes are not secure a priori. Indeed, designing effective masking programs is a labor intensive and error-prone task. Although some techniques have been proposed for formally verifying masking countermeasures and for quantifying masking strength, they are currently limited to Boolean programs and suffer from low accuracy.
                    In this talk, I will present our recent results on formal verification of cryptographic programs against power side-channel attacks. First, I will talk about a refinement based qualitative verification approach that can be viewed as a synergistic integration of a rule-based approach for inferring distribution types and an model-counting based approach for refining these types. Second, I will present an algorithm for quantifying the amount of side-channel information leakage from a software implementation using the notion of quantitative masking strength. Finally, I will discuss some open problems for future work.</p>
